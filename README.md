### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tucker Paron, a data scientist living in Vermont (originally from Connecticut) passionate about the use of data to explore and investigate my own curiosities. Health & Sports are some of my main interests - particularly regarding wearable and tracking data for performance analysis - but I also really enjoy learning about psychology, philosophy, education/housing policy, and social dynamics!
